# Brazil-Hexagon-Wall

The main objetctive of this routine is to generate *n* hexagon side by side forming a set of hexagon as a **hexagon wall**, similar to a *bee hive* but with a shape aproximately with the Brazil's geometry coordinates. The inspiration for this work comes from the [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild Bol's post](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/blog/user-2018-feature-wall/) posted in JULY 11, 2018. The hex sticker feature wall was presented at useR! 2018, in Birsbane, and yhis involved arranging approximately 200 stickers in the shape of Australia. Our goal is to replicate this for Brazil.

We divide this routine in 3 steps: 

- First one, we will use the function hexwal which is implemented in the file `hexwall.R` written by [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall) which can be found on his [Github](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall) or simply downloaded by clicking [Here](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall/archive/master.zip).
