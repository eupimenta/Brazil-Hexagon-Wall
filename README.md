# Brazil-Hexagon-Wall

The main objetctive of this routine is to generate *n* hexagon side by side forming a set of hexagon as a **hexagon wall**, similar to a *bee hive* but with a shape aproximately with the Brazil's geometry coordinates. The inspiration for this work comes from the [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild Bol's post](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/blog/user-2018-feature-wall/) posted in JULY 11, 2018. The hex sticker feature wall was presented at [useR! 2018](http://user2018.r-project.org/), in Birsbane, and yhis involved arranging approximately 200 stickers in the shape of Australia. Our goal is to replicate this for Brazil.

But, Why hexagons to fill the area of a map? 

*"There are many reasons for using hexagons, at least over squares. Hexagons have symmetry of nearest neighbors which is lacking in square bins. Hexagons are the maximum number of sides a polygon can have for a regular tesselation of the plane, so in terms of packing a hexagon is 13% more efficient for covering the plane than squares. "*

We divide this routine in 3 steps: 

- First one, we will use the function hexwal which is implemented in the file `hexwall.R` written by [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall) which can be found on his [Github](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall) or simply downloaded by clicking [Here](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall/archive/master.zip).
