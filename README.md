# Brazil-Hexagon-Wall

The main objetctive of this routine is to generate *n* hexagon side by side forming a set of hexagon as a **hexagon wall**, similar to a *bee hive* but with a shape aproximately with the Brazil's geometry coordinates.

For that, we will use but the function hexwal which is implemented in the file `hexwall.R` written by [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall) which can be found on this [Github](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall) or simply downloaded by clicking [Here](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/hexwall/archive/master.zip).
